# React.js SPA on OpenFaaS With Dockferfile Template in Static mode

Minimal React.js Single Page Application packaged for OpenFaaS with the dockerfile template and the watchdog in static mode.
The client-side routing is done with React-Router.

The issue is that any page other than the homepage will return a 404 error when requested from the server (when refreshing the page).

A Single Page Application technically only have a single index.html, and should redirect every possible url pointed to the domain at
this index.html located at the root.

This is usually done with a catch-all rule on an Express server or Nginx reverse proxy.

Note that the website is served at https://DOMAIN_NAME/function/react-spa by adding `PUBLIC_URL=/function/react-spa` in .env and
setting the `basename` property passed to the Router component.


## Step to Reproduce

Go directly to https://openfaas-ingress-janaka-steph.cloud.okteto.net/function/react-spa/about

Or go to https://openfaas-ingress-janaka-steph.cloud.okteto.net/function/react-spa +
Navigate to About +
Refresh the page +


## Open Question

Can we deploy an SPA with the watchdog static mode without adding an Express server or Nginx?
